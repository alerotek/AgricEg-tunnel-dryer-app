A digital tool designed to support smallholder farmers — starting in Kilifi, Kenya — with efficient post-harvest drying using solar tunnel dryers. The app enables tracking of drying sessions, analyzing outcomes, and improving crop quality and shelf life.

---

## 🌿 Project Goal

To reduce post-harvest losses by helping farmers digitally monitor solar drying operations, maintain drying logs, and get data-driven insights on efficiency.

---

## 🧰 Features

- 📦 Batch logging (crop type, weight, start/end time)
- 🌞 Drying session tracking & dryer utilization
- 📊 Analytics: drying time, weight loss, efficiency
- 📝 Notes & feedback for continuous improvement

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- `Python` (Flask or Streamlit)
- `Google Sheets` / `SQLite` (data handling)
- `HTML/CSS` (for optional UI enhancements)
- Deployment: Local or low-cost cloud platforms
